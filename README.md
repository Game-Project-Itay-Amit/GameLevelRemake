# GameLevelRemake

itch.io: https://amitay2022.itch.io/game-level-remake

There is only one scene that shows the remade level. there is also a screenshot [here](https://github.com/Game-Project-Itay-Amit/GameLevelRemake/blob/main/Assets/game.png) that shows the original.

This is the only game on myabandonware.com we could find that could be run on windows and had the source files.
We personally found this game quite disturbing.
